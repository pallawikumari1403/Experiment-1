THEORY:-Mathematical Operations in Python


Python provides built-in operators to perform basic mathematical calculations easily.

Addition (Sum): The + operator is used to add two or more numbers in Python.

Subtraction: The - operator is used to subtract one number from another.

Multiplication: The * operator is used to multiply numbers.

Division: The / operator performs division and always returns a float value.

Floor Division: The // operator returns the quotient without the decimal part.

Modulus Operation: The % operator returns the remainder of a division.

Power Operation: The ** operator is used to raise a number to a power.

ALGORITHM:-Algorithm to Perform Sum Operation

Step 1: Start

Step 2: Declare two variables a and b

Step 3: Read the values of a and b

Step 4: Calculate sum = a + b

Step 5: Display the value of sum

Step 6: Stop
Likewise we can perform all the mathematical operation 


Area of a Circle (Basic Formula):The area of a circle is calculated using the formula π × r × r, where r is the radius.

Calculating Area of a Circle in Python

Python can calculate the area of a circle by using a fixed value of π (3.14).

Math Library in Python: Python provides a built-in math module for advanced mathematical operations.

Area of a Circle Using Math Library

The value of π can be accessed using math.pi for more accurate results.

Algorithm to Calculate Area of a Circle (Without Math Library)

Step 1: Start

Step 2: Declare variable r for radius

Step 3: Read the value of r

Step 4: Assign value π = 3.14

Step 5: Calculate area using formula

  area = π × r × r
  
Step 6: Display the area of the circle

Step 7: Stop


COMPARISON :This program compares two numbers entered by the user and tells which one is smaller or greater.


Steps for comparision:

step 1: Ask the user to enter a value for a, Store it in variable a.

step 2: Ask the user to enter a value for b,Store it in variable b.

step 3: Compare the two values:

step 4: If b < a, then b is smaller than a, Otherwise, a is smaller than or equal to b

Display the appropriate message.

step 5: Stop

Logarithmic Operations: Logarithmic functions are used to calculate logarithms of numbers.

Natural Logarithm: The math.log() function calculates the natural logarithm (base e).

Logarithm with Base 10

The math.log10() function is used to calculate logarithms with base 10.

Algorithm to Calculate Area of a Circle Using Math Library

Step 1: Start

Step 2: Import the math library

Step 3: Declare variable r for radius

Step 4: Read the value of r

Step 5: Calculate area using formula

 area = math.pi × r × r
 
Step 6: Display the area of the circle

Step 7: Stop

CONCLUSION:- WE HAVE SUCCESSFULLY PERFORMED THE OPERATIONS IN PYTHON AND WE HAD UNDERSTOOD THE BASIC CONCEPTS OF PYTHON.
